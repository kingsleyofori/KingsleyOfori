# Hello, I'm Kingsley Ofori üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

**`Data Craftsman (Data Analytics, Machine Learning)`**

A land economist who also doubles as a self-taught data analyst. When I'm not busy utilizing my superhuman economic abilities to save the world, you can find me learning new skills, coding, and working on projects involving machine learning, data science, and data visualization. I spend my time using `python`, `mysql`, `tableau`, and `powerbi` to address pertinent challenges affecting the real estate sector and the wider globe. The projects you'll discover here have been constructed from the ground up, starting with the planning and designing phase and ending with the use of code to address actual issues.

 <summary><h3>üë®‚Äçüíª Kingsley's Data Analytics Journey in 60 seconds</h3></summary>
I made my first venture into data science around June 2022 when I made the decision to spend my entire day studying it. I had no prior experience with computer programming when I first began out as a student, but after watching my first YouTube courses, I fell in love with MySQL. In all honesty, I was craving more. With my new skill set, I wanted to almost completely understand everything before I started looking for a career in data science. After MySQL, I began attending Power BI courses to learn how to visually exhibit my exported queries. For someone like me, who had no prior experience with computers, making this change was a major step. I wanted more, though. I was first worried that I wouldn't be able to learn Python and become skilled with it because I don't have a background in computer science. I quickly skimmed a five-minute YouTube tutorial on Python and was impressed by the mention of pandas and the numpy package. Going back in time, I was able to pick up Python and add it to my list of essential technological skills. I take delight in having learned this new ability because it has been one of my life's successes. Additionally, I enjoy the daily opportunity to learn something new. Mate, join me on this journey!
